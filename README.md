Using SQLite3, NodeJS, AngularJS, ExpressJS, the website gives a random episode of Seinfeld when requested. The user can then save the episode to a "watched" list and that list to a user account. Uses cookies so the user does not have to create an account to generate episodes.

The purpose is to watch all of Seinfeld in a random order. Not particully useful if you don't have the boxed set or Hulu, but this project was more of a learning experience for me.
